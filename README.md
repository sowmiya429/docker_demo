-Why because initially docker installed on the root user it doesn't give permission to the root user
-To give permission to the UBUNTU user. Because here we use UBUNTU 
-Use the below command to give permission to the UBUNTU user
```
sudo usermod -aG docker ubuntu
```
-usermod --> modifying the user
-aG docker--> adding the ubuntu user to the docker group
After this still we got the same error
